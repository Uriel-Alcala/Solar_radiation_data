# Solar_radiation_data
As part of this study to monitor and evaluate solar irradiance in agricultural applications, data was collected using two sensors: a BH1750 sensor and a Davis Instruments 6450 solar radiation sensor. Both sensors were integrated into a custom PCB and operated for a period of 30 days, resulting in the acquisition of 10,000 data points. To ensure accuracy, the Davis Instruments 6450 sensor installed on the PCB was calibrated using a reference Davis Instruments 6450 sensor mounted on a professional weather station.
